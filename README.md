# Static base

This repo is a **fresh start** to create a custom website (static adaptation of [Roadiz BaseTheme](https://github.com/roadiz/BaseTheme/)).

* **Find and replace** every `StaticBase` occurences over this folder using your own project name, verify in:
    * Absolute paths in `bootstrap.js`
* Do not forget to `npm install` and `bower install` in your `static` folder.

## Extrenal JS framework

Base theme uses *Gulp* and *Bower* to deal with front development files.
We chose to use **ES6 javascript** transpiled with *Babel* and loaded via *RequireJS*.

Then we externalized all the JS logic and routing system into https://github.com/rezozero/pageblock-framework
so that your theme only host specific JS code and will be able to easily upgrade common JS features.

We encourage to read *Page-Block* README: https://github.com/rezozero/pageblock-framework/blob/master/README.md
to understand how we route and synchronize our *Twig* generated DOM with our ES6 scripts. 

### Bootstrap

We use *Bootstrap* right in *StaticBase* but you can choose what feature to include in your style not to bloat your CSS files. 
We recommend to use *LESS* version to ignore unnecessary modules.
Open your `static/less/styles.less` and comment/uncomment your *Bootstrap*
modules files, you even can override *Bootstrap* variables.

### Gulp

This blank theme uses *Gulp* to manage your LESS, JS and CSS files. 
When you set it up, Gulp will generate versioned CSS and JS files to 
be properly served over browser caches.

First of all, go to `static/` folder.

* Install *NodeJS* - http://nodejs.org/
* Install *Bower* - http://bower.io/
* Install *gulp-cli* - https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md
* Install theme development tools `npm install`
* Install bower theme dependancies `bower install`

Then you can launch *Gulp* in background to listen every file update: this command will
generate development CSS file (with source-map and not-minified) and transpile your ES6 scripts.

```shell
gulp watch
```

And when you need to prepare files for production: this command will generate production CSS
files (no source-map and minified) and will optimize *requireJS* dependence tree into
a single JS bundle in `static/build/` folder.

```shell
gulp
```

### Versioning

Versioning is really important in order to avoid browser and public cache problems after
a site update.

Gulp will generate a `build/` folder for optimized JS file and a `css/` for CSS files, all files
will have random generated name suffix. Then *Gulp* will inject these files directly into your
`Resources/views/base.html.twig` template at each change.

For *LESS* files, it’s a bit different. To add a new *LESS* file, just include it in `static/less/style.less`
file, which is your main project stylesheet. For *Bower* stylesheet, just do the same in `static/less/vendor.less`.
Do not forget to use `@import (inline)` syntax to force *LESS* compiler to include files contents if 
you want to import plain CSS files.

#### In development mode

When you work with `gulp watch` running in background, *Gulp* will only compile your *LESS* files in `static/css/` folder 
and transpile your ES6 javascript files into `dist/` folder. It won’t optimize nor uglify your JS. 

#### In production mode

When you execute a `gulp` command, *Gulp* will compile your *LESS* files
and it will optimize your *RequireJS* tree with your *Bower* dependencies and your own *JS* files into
`/static/build` folder. As in development mode, *Twig* will automatically inject your assets to
insert as many `<script>` and `<link>` tags as needed.
